Week Four

Day 10

Web browser, or browser is a program used to access information on the World Wide Web

API - application programming interface - using programs to talk to other software

Web APIs - 

Eg using javascript to manipulate the website properties (that is an example of API use)


Window - reserved keyword, console.log(this) will output window

Document Object Model (DOM) - representation of document as an object (Like a family tree there are parents, siblings, and children nodes)

Traversing the DOM - going between the relationships of different nodes

Document.querySelector()- is like getElementByID()/getElementByClass() but more recent 



Day 11

addEventListener adds an event variable to the function and this event can be used to prevent default nature of submit for (refreshes page)

Input tag type(text, num) - num will create an increment button on the side (like a drop down with an up arrow too)

Array has method foreach which acts like a for loop and iterates through each element in the array

Event listener bubbling bubbles up starting from the child to the parent and so on until the document (if they are all ). To stop this effect can use stopPropagation but don't use because it bad practice (affects other things)

Event Delegation - applying the event listener to the parent container of multiple children and regardless of which one we click, they will all trigger the parent as they bubble up. This allows the click event to be repeated.

Day 12

Local Storage - localStorage.setItem / localStorage.getItem
JSON - Javascript Object Notation (String version of the object)

Text content vs inner html - with innerHtml can also insert html tags (eg span)

Never store passwords, credentials, on local storage
